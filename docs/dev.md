## Current Challenges :

### Technical Challenges
1. **Dense Object Detection**
   - Handling Overlapping Products
   - Balancing Anchor Coverage

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Large # of anchors (159,375)
   - Memory Usage
   - Training Speed on CPU is pretty slow -> *Trying to figure out how to improve.*

3. **Data Processing**
   - Complex Augmentation Pipeline
   - Box Coordinate Transformations
   - Maintaining Valid Boxes After Augmentation

### Development Priorities
1. **Immediate**
   - Improve Visualization Tools

2. **Short-term**
   - Optimize Anchor System
   - Improve Training Efficiency
   - Add Progress Tracking

3. **Long-term**
   - Multi-GPU Support

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Simplified Anchor System Improved Stability
   - Normalized Coordinates helped our Loss Computation
   - Debug Mode is NECESSARY for fixing training errors.

2. **Training Insights**
   - 20 matches per target improved detection
   - Box regression needs normalized coordinates
