# RETAIL PRODUCT DETECTION PROJECT - CURRENT APPROACH

## 1. DATASET HANDLING

### a) Data Organization
- Using SKU-110K dataset structure
- Images stored in train/val/test splits
- Annotations contain bounding box coordinates
- Currently using test mode with 5 sample images

### b) Data Processing Pipeline
- Loading images using OpenCV
- Converting BGR to RGB
- Resizing to 640x640
- Normalizing using ImageNet statistics
- Converting to PyTorch tensor format (CHW)
- Caching processed images for speed

### c) Ground Truth Processing
- Converting bounding boxes to grid format (20x20)
- Creating objectness targets (1 where object exists)
- Creating box coordinate targets

## 2. MODEL ARCHITECTURE

### a) Backbone: ResNet50
- Pretrained on ImageNet
- Removed final classification layers
- Outputs 2048-channel feature maps

### b) Vision Transformer (ViT) Layer
- Takes CNN features as input
- Processes spatial relationships
- Adds positional embeddings
- Multiple transformer blocks

### c) Detection Head
- Predicts 5 values per grid cell:
  * 4 for box coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)
  * 1 for objectness score

## 3. TRAINING PIPELINE

### a) Optimization
- Using AdamW optimizer
- Learning rate from config
- Weight decay for regularization

### b) Loss Functions
- SmoothL1Loss for bounding boxes
- BCEWithLogitsLoss for objectness

### c) Training Loop
- Epoch-based training
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Performance monitoring (time/sample)
- Regular validation checks

## 4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### a) Data Loading
- Multi-worker data loading
- Image caching
- Persistent workers
- Pin memory for faster GPU transfer

### b) GPU Utilization
- Automatic GPU detection
- CUDA optimization if available
- Batch size optimization

### c) Memory Management
- Gradient clearing between batches
- Efficient tensor operations
- Proper device placement

## 5. MONITORING AND LOGGING

### a) Progress Tracking
- Per-batch statistics
- Epoch summaries
- Training/validation metrics

### b) Performance Metrics
- Training loss
- Validation metrics (precision, recall, F1)
- Processing speed (images/second)

### c) Model Checkpointing
- Regular interval saves
- Best model preservation
- Training state preservation

## 6. CURRENT WORKFLOW
1. Initialize datasets and data loaders
2. Set up model with optimizations
3. Configure training parameters
4. Run training loop:
   - Process batches
   - Calculate losses
   - Update model
   - Validate periodically
5. Save checkpoints and logs
6. Monitor performance metrics

## 7. NEXT STEPS
1. Move to full dataset training
2. Implement advanced augmentations
3. Add distributed training support
4. Optimize hyperparameters
5. Implement inference pipeline
6. Add visualization tools

> **Note**: Currently running in test mode with 5 images to verify pipeline functionality before moving to full dataset training.
